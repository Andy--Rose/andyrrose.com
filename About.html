				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h3>Snowboarding</h3>
				<p>
					I learned to ski at 3 years old and was finally allowed to snowboard at 7.<br />
					<img id="img_snow" class="img-responsive" src="images/pictures/snowboard.bmp" /><br />
					After teaching for 12 years, I got a full-time job and decided to give up
					teaching in order to have more riding time. But I still like to teach and I
					am always happy to help others learn!
				</p>
				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>
					I was a DJ in college for 5 years, performing weddings and playing weekly at a local bar.
					It wasn't until I stopped when I realized how much I really loved to DJ. Armed with my passion
					for electronic music, I picked up a table in 2014 to mix for fun. <br />

					This is a picture of my setup during our weekly 4.5 hour drives to Tahoe for snowboarding when 
					I lived in N. Cal.
					<br />
					After getting the deck, I also got into the producing side, getting Ableton Live 9 suite.
					Having never taken a music class in my life, I am still learning a lot, but having a great time
					doing it!
