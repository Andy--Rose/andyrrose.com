					<b>About This Site</b><br />
					This is a professional website. Its purpose is to display my skills as a Software Engineer.
					On this site, you will find general information about myself and documentation of projects
					that I have been a part of.<br />
					Along with the projects listed, the development of this site has also been a project for me as I 
					have been independently researching web development and familiarizing myself with the 
					latest techniques and technology. This website uses HTML5 and CSS3 and was created in notepad.
					The reason for using notepad, though it takes much longer, is to solidify the knowledge I gain 
					while creating this website. It is currently a work 
					in progress. If you have any input for me, I would love to hear from you! Just send a 
					message to my email, found on the <a href="Info.html">Info/Skills</a> page.
					<br />
					Coming Soon: Mobile Site, Animation

					About Me
				</h3>
				<p id="aboutMe" style="margin-top:0;padding:0;width:40%;float:left;">
					As a recent college graduate, I am currently looking for an entry-level job in the field of 
					Software Development. Particularly, I would be interested in a job in the field of UI/UX 
					design or Video Game Development. This is because I enjoy working with/for the end user and 
					coming up with new ways to reach out to all demographics of users from beginner to expert. 
					This does not however limit my job search to this specifically. I love to learn new things 
					would be ecstatic for an opportunity to work in any field of software development.<br />
					For a geek, I have a very active lifestyle, spending most of my free time outside. I am 
					incredibly passionate about extreme sports. Snowboarding is my favorite sport in existence. 
					I grew up playing baseball, football, wrestling, basketball, and pretty much every other 
					sport out there, but the mountain has always been my home. During the off season I like to 
					go hiking, swim at the lake, and do things outdoors. My nights are typically split between 
					spending time with friends or family and staying in playing Xbox.<br />
					<br />

					Though I know it is redundant and doesn't say anything about me, I would like to 
					convey my personal strengths. Along with those, I will also point out some weaknesses
					because I believe that only someone that can point out their own flaws can correct them.
					<br />
					<b>Strengths</b><br />
					Dedication<br />Dependability<br />Resourcefulness<br />Creativity<br />
					<b>Weaknesses</b><br />
					Hyper-Focus<br />Perfectionism<br />Memorization
					<br /><br />
					When working on a project, I find it incredibly hard to stop working until what I am 
					working on is finished. I am a very task-oriented person, so I usually split a major 
					task into sub-tasks that are reasonable to complete in a day or two. This way I can 
					fulfill a projects requirements by a scheduled deadline.
