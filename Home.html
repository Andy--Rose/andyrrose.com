						<b>About This Site</b><br />
						This is a professional website. Its purpose is to display my skills as a Software Engineer.
						On this site, you will find general information about myself and documentation of projects
						that I have been a part of.<br />
						Along with the projects listed, the development of this site has also been a project for me as I 
						have been independently researching web development and familiarizing myself with the 
						latest techniques and technology. This website uses HTML5 and CSS3 and was created in notepad.
						The reason for using notepad, though it takes much longer, is to solidify the knowledge I gain 
						while creating this website. It is currently a work 
						in progress. If you have any input for me, I would love to hear from you! Just send a 
						message to my email, found on the <a href="Info.html">Info/Skills</a> page.
						<br />
						Coming Soon: Blog Page, Mobile Site, Animation

					<h2 style="margin-left:50px;">About Me</h2>
					<p id="aboutMe" style="margin:0;margin-left:50px;padding:0;width:40%;float:left;">
						As a recent college graduate, I am excited to begin building professional experience. 
						Currently, my job involves many different tasks from creating system tools to testing.
						This format is perfect for me because there are so many things that I want to learn still 
						in the field of software engineering.<br />
						
						For a geek, I have a very active lifestyle, spending much of my free time outside. I am 
						most passionate about extreme sports, Snowboarding being my favorite. 
						I grew up playing baseball, football, wrestling, basketball, and pretty much every other 
						sport out there, but the mountain has always been my home. During the summer, I like to 
						go hiking, swim at the lake, or any other activities that will work off my farmers tan. 
						Other than that, I love watching football and going to rock or electronic concerts. 
						My nights are typically split between spending time with friends or family and staying 
						in playing Xbox.<br />
