					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<h3>Snowboarding</h3>
					<p>
						I learned to ski at 3 years old and was finally allowed to snowboard at 7.<br />

						After teaching for 12 years, I got a full-time job and decided to give up
						teaching in order to have more riding time. But I still like to teach and I
						am always happy to help others learn!
					</p>
					<h3>Music</h3>
					<p>
						I was a DJ in college for 5 years, performing weddings and playing weekly at a local bar.
						It wasn't until I stopped when I realized how much I really loved to DJ. Armed with my passion
						for electronic music, I picked up a table in 2014 to mix for fun. <br />

						This is a picture of my setup during our weekly 4.5 hour drives to Tahoe for snowboarding when 
						I lived in N. Cal.
						<br />
						After getting the deck, I also got into the producing side, getting Ableton Live 9 suite.
						Having never taken a music class in my life, I am still learning a lot, but having a great time
						doing it!
