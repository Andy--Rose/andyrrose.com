				This is a paper examining autonomous driving and analysing the moral issues surrounding
				the new technology. In this paper you will find information on research for autonomous 
				driving as well as a look into legislation concerning integration of the new technology.
				Also discussed is the argument regaurding whether the positive effects of releasing this 
				concept outweigh the forseen negative outcomes. If you are interested in autonomous driving
				or the problems faced when introducing new technologies, please take a look at my paper.
