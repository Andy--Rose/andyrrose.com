				<td>Summary:</td>
				<td>This program is designed to run as a P.O.S. for the rental shop at a private ski school, 
				   Webbski, located at the Summit at Snoqualmie. The program is built to store information on all
				   of the customers, as well as the equipment. It also tracks each individual payment 
				   transaction and rental event. All of the tables are linked to maximize the availability
				   of comparisons for reference purposes. The database is changed using dynamically created
				   SQL commands. The program is geared toward optimal speed for the user. The way that the 
				   program is designed is also to work on an older computer, as the Ski School did not have
				   money for a new system. This is done by pre-rendering all of the information in the 
				   database at startup so that the program does not get bogged down by heavy database
				   transactions during the busy times of the day.</td>

		<h3>Autonomous Driving Paper</h3>
		<p class="tier3">
			This is a paper examining autonomous driving and analysing the moral issues surrounding
			the new technology. In this paper you will find information on research for autonomous 
			driving as well as a look into legislation concerning integration of the new technology.
			Also discussed is the argument regaurding whether the positive effects of releasing this 
			concept outweigh the forseen negative outcomes. If you are interested in autonomous driving
			or the problems faced when introducing new technologies, please take a look at my paper.
